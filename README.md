- **Product & Business Analytics:** Defining KPIs, writing SQL-first analyses, validating results in Python
- **Forecasting & Data Science:** Using interpretable baselines before introducing complex models
- **Applied GenAI:** Prompt engineering, ambiguity handling, and guardrail-driven analytics assistants

---

### Tool Stack
**Languages:**  Python, SQL  

**Data & Analytics:**  Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter  

**Big Data & Warehousing:**  Google BigQuery, SQL-based analytics on large datasets  

**Visualization & BI:**  Tableau, Power BI, Excel  

**Data Engineering & Cloud:**  Git/GitHub, YAML-based configs, modular pipelines  
AWS (S3, Glue, Redshift – exposure)  

**GenAI & AI Concepts:**  Prompt engineering, prompt templates, ambiguity handling, guardrails, CLI-based tooling  

---

### How I Work
- Partner with **product managers, analysts, and engineers** to clarify requirements
- Convert vague business questions into **explicit metrics and assumptions**
- Prioritize **readability, reproducibility, and safety** over over-engineering
- Comfortable operating in **cross-functional, fast-paced environments**
